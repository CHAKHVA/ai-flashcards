# Flashcards Extension with Hand Gestures - Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Goal

To create a browser extension that allows users to save flashcards by highlighting text on webpages and practice them using a spaced repetition system (Modified Leitner) with hand gestures via webcam instead of traditional button clicks.

### 1.2. Main Components

1.  **Content Script:** Injects an "Add to Flashcards" button when text is highlighted on any webpage.
2.  **Browser Extension Popup:** A small window, triggered by the in-page button or the toolbar icon, used *only* for adding/saving new flashcards.
3.  **Flashcard Learner Page:** A separate, dedicated web page using NextJS where users practice their saved flashcards using the spaced repetition system and gesture recognition.
4.  **Gesture Recognition Window:** A secondary, smaller window launched from the Learner Page to display the webcam feed and detect hand gestures.
5.  **Local Storage:** Used as the primary data store for all flashcards and practice history.

### 1.3. Core Technologies

*   Browser Extension APIs (Manifest V3 recommended)
*   NextJS, TailwindCSS
*   TensorFlow.js (HandPose model) for gesture recognition
*   UUID library for generating unique IDs
*   Mocha/Chai for testing

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Flashcard Saving (Extension Popup & Content Script)

*   **Workflow 1 (Highlighting):**
    1.  User highlights text on any webpage.
    2.  The Content Script detects the highlight and injects a small "Add to Flashcards" button near the selection.
    3.  User clicks the "Add to Flashcards" button.
    4.  The Browser Extension Popup opens.
    5.  The 'Back' text area in the popup is pre-filled with the highlighted text.
    6.  The 'Front' text area is empty.
    7.  User manually types the 'Front' content.
    8.  User can optionally fill in 'Hint' and 'Tags' (comma-separated).
    9.  User clicks 'Save Card'.
    10. Go to "Save Action".
*   **Workflow 2 (Toolbar Icon):**
    1.  User clicks the extension's icon in the browser toolbar.
    2.  The Browser Extension Popup opens.
    3.  'Front', 'Back', 'Hint', and 'Tags' fields are all initially empty.
    4.  User manually fills 'Front' and 'Back'.
    5.  User can optionally fill in 'Hint' and 'Tags'.
    6.  User clicks 'Save Card'.
    7.  Go to "Save Action".
*   **Save Action:**
    1.  **Validation:** Check if 'Front' and 'Back' fields are non-empty. If invalid, show an error message and do not proceed.
    2.  **Data Creation:** Create a `Flashcard` object (see Data Structures). Generate a unique UUID for the `id`. Set `bucket` to `0`.
    3.  **Storage:** Call `saveCard` logic (see Function Specifications) which reads the existing `flashcards` array from Local Storage, adds the new card, and writes the updated array back.
    4.  **Feedback:** Display a temporary message "Card saved successfully!" within the popup.
    5.  **Auto-Close:** Automatically close the popup ~1.5 seconds after showing the success message.
*   **UI Elements (Popup):**
    *   Text input for 'Front'.
    *   Text area for 'Back'.
    *   Text input for 'Hint (optional)'.
    *   Text input for 'Tags (comma-separated)'.
    *   'Save Card' button.
    *   'Clear' button (optional, to clear fields).
    *   Area for feedback messages.

### 2.2. Spaced Repetition Learning (Flashcard Learner Page)

*   **Access:** User navigates to the dedicated Learner Page (e.g., by opening a specific HTML file bundled with the extension).
*   **Session State:**
    *   Maintains a temporary `currentDay` counter in memory, starting at `1` each time the page is loaded. This counter is **not** persisted in Local Storage.
*   **Initiating Practice for a Day:**
    1.  On page load (or when advancing day), call `practice(currentDay, allCardsFromStorage)` (see Function Specifications) to get the list of cards due for practice.
    2.  Display the `currentDay` number (e.g., "Day 1").
    3.  If cards are due:
        *   Display progress (e.g., "Card 1 of X").
        *   Display the 'Front' of the first card.
        *   Show 'Get Hint' and 'Show Answer' buttons.
        *   Show an "Enable Camera" button (only if not already enabled for the session).
    4.  If no cards are due:
        *   Display "No more cards to practice today!".
        *   Show "Go to Next Day" button.
*   **Gesture Window Initiation:**
    1.  User clicks "Enable Camera".
    2.  Browser requests camera permission (if needed).
    3.  A separate, smaller "Gesture Window" opens.
    4.  Webcam feed starts in the Gesture Window.
    5.  HandPose model loads (show "Loading Model...").
    6.  Gesture Window indicates readiness (e.g., "Detecting...").
    7.  The Gesture Window remains open until the user navigates away from the Learner Page or potentially closes it manually (manual close behavior TBD, maybe add a Disable button).
*   **Practice Flow (Per Card):**
    1.  **Hint:** User clicks 'Get Hint'. Call `getHint(currentCard)` (see Function Specifications). Display the returned hint text below the button (prefixed with "Hint: "). Button should be disabled if `card.hint` is empty/null. This action is purely informational and doesn't affect grading.
    2.  **Show Answer:** User clicks 'Show Answer'.
        *   Display the 'Back' text of the card.
        *   Hide 'Get Hint' and 'Show Answer' buttons.
        *   Display instructions for gestures: "üëç Easy, üëé Wrong, ‚úã Hard".
        *   The Learner Page now waits for a gesture result from the Gesture Window.
    3.  **Gesture Input (in Gesture Window):**
        *   TensorFlow.js HandPose model continuously analyzes the webcam feed.
        *   If üëç, üëé, or ‚úã is detected:
            *   Display detected gesture icon and name (e.g., "üëç Easy").
            *   Start a 3-second timer/counter visible to the user (e.g., "Hold detected: 1... 2... 3").
            *   If the gesture is held consistently for 3 seconds:
                *   Send the result ('Easy', 'Hard', or 'Wrong') back to the Learner Page using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
            *   If the gesture changes or is lost before 3 seconds, reset the timer and feedback.
    4.  **Processing Result (in Learner Page):**
        *   Learner page listens for messages via `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener`.
        *   On receiving a gesture result message (e.g., `{ type: 'GESTURE_RESULT', payload: 'Easy' }`):
            *   Record the `currentBucket` of the card being practiced.
            *   Call `update(currentCard.id, receivedRating, allCards)` (see Function Specifications) to get the `newAllCards` list with the updated bucket.
            *   Call `addHistoryRecord(currentCard.id, receivedRating, currentBucket, newBucket, currentHistory)` (see Function Specifications) to get the `newHistory` list.
            *   Save `newAllCards` to the `flashcards` key in Local Storage.
            *   Save `newHistory` to the `practiceHistory` key in Local Storage.
            *   Update the `allCards` and `practiceHistory` variables in memory.
            *   Advance to the next card or finish the day (see below).
*   **Advancing / End of Day:**
    1.  After processing a card's result, check if there are more cards in the current day's queue.
    2.  If yes:
        *   Clear the previous card's display.
        *   Display the 'Front' of the next card.
        *   Update the progress indicator ("Card X of Y").
        *   Show 'Get Hint' and 'Show Answer' buttons for the new card.
    3.  If no (last card was just processed):
        *   Clear the card display area.
        *   Display "No more cards to practice today!".
        *   Show the "Go to Next Day" button.
*   **Going to Next Day:**
    1.  User clicks "Go to Next Day".
    2.  Increment the in-memory `currentDay` counter.
    3.  Call `practice(currentDay, allCards)` to get the cards for the new day.
    4.  Update the UI to show the new day number and either the first card or the "No more cards..." message, restarting the practice flow for the new day.

### 2.3. Progress Tracking

*   A function `computeProgress(allCards, history)` (see Function Specifications) calculates statistics.
*   **Metrics Calculated:**
    *   `totalCards`: Total number of flashcards.
    *   `cardsByBucket`: An object mapping bucket number to the count of cards in that bucket (e.g., `{0: 10, 1: 5, 2: 3}`). Ensure all buckets up to the max have entries, even if 0.
    *   `totalPracticeEvents`: Total number of entries in the `practiceHistory`.
    *   `successRate`: Percentage of practice events marked 'Easy' or 'Hard'. `(Easy + Hard) / totalPracticeEvents * 100`. Returns 0 if `totalPracticeEvents` is 0.
    *   `averageMovesPerCard`: Average number of practice events per unique card present in the history. `totalPracticeEvents / uniqueCardsInHistory`. Returns 0 if no history.
*   **Display:** (To be determined - Could be a separate section/modal on the Learner Page activated by a 'Stats' button).

## 3. Data Structures

### 3.1. Local Storage

*   **`flashcards` (Key):** Stores a JSON string representing an array of `Flashcard` objects.
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "uuid-string-1",
        "front": "Front text",
        "back": "Back text",
        "hint": "Optional hint text",
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
        "bucket": 0
      },
      { ... }
    ]
    ```
*   **`practiceHistory` (Key):** Stores a JSON string representing an array of `PracticeRecord` objects.
    ```json
    [
      {
        "cardId": "uuid-string-1",
        "timestamp": 1678886400000,
        "difficulty": "Easy",
        "previousBucket": 0,
        "newBucket": 1
      },
      { ... }
    ]
    ```

## 5. Engineering Requirements

*   **Specifications:** Every public function must have a detailed specification, as demonstrated above.
*   **Abstraction Function (AF) & Representation Invariant (RI):** Define AF and RI for key data structures (e.g., `Flashcard` class/object, the list representation in Local Storage).
    *   **Example `Flashcard` RI:** `id` is non-empty UUID string; `front`, `back` are non-empty strings; `hint` is string/null/undefined; `tags` is array of strings; `bucket` is non-negative integer.
*   **`checkRep()`:** Implement `checkRep()` methods or functions to assert Representation Invariants at critical points (e.g., after reading from Local Storage, before writing, potentially start/end of key methods).
*   **Code Quality:** Aim for code that is:
    *   **SFB (Safe From Bugs):** Defensive programming, thorough testing, use of types (TypeScript recommended).
    *   **ETU (Easy To Understand):** Clear naming, comments where necessary, consistent style, modular design.
    *   **RFC (Ready For Change):** Decoupled components (e.g., UI vs. logic), pure functions where possible, adherence to specs.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git and push often to a repository (e.g., GitHub) with small, atomic commits and descriptive messages.
*   **Development Process:** Follow Test-First Programming (TFP): Write Spec -> Write Test -> Write Code -> Iterate.

## 6. Testing Requirements

*   **Framework:** Use Mocha and Chai (or a similar standard JavaScript testing framework).
*   **Scope:** Write thorough unit tests for every public function specified in Section 4. Test UI interaction logic where feasible.
*   **Strategy:** Include a testing strategy comment at the beginning of each test suite file, outlining the partitions and cases being tested for that unit.
*   **Test Types:**
    *   Test with correct inputs covering different valid scenarios.
    *   Test with incorrect inputs (invalid types, values outside ranges, missing properties) to ensure error handling works.
    *   Test edge cases (e.g., empty lists, day 1, bucket 0, max bucket).
    *   Use glass box testing: write tests specifically designed to catch likely implementation errors based on the code's structure (e.g., off-by-one errors, incorrect loop bounds, mutation of inputs when purity is expected).
*   **Coverage:** Use a code coverage tool (e.g., `nyc` integrated with `npm run coverage`) and aim for high statement, branch, and function coverage for the core logic functions. Review coverage reports to identify untested code paths.
